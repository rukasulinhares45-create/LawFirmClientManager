Build a complete application for managing clients of a law firm, with a web (desktop) version and responsive support for mobile devices.

⚠️ Important: The entire application interface, labels, and messages must be in Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR).

🔐 Access and Security Requirements

Access to the system must be through login and password.

Credentials (username and temporary password) will be pre-created by the administrator.

On the first login, the user must be required to change the password.

Implement best security practices, including:

Password encryption (e.g., bcrypt)

Authenticated sessions (JWT or secure cookies)

Protection against SQL Injection, XSS, and CSRF

Activity logs (who accessed, when, and what was changed)

👥 User Roles

Administrator (Admin):

Creates, edits, and deactivates users.

Defines permissions and manages system-wide configurations.

Regular User:

Accesses, views, and manages information as allowed by their permissions.

Can register clients, upload documents, and create legal forms.

🧾 Client Management

The system must allow registering and managing clients of the law firm, which can be:

Individual (Pessoa Física)

Company (Pessoa Jurídica)

Each client record must include:

Full name / Company name

CPF / CNPJ

RG / State registration (optional)

Date and place of birth

Full address

Phone number(s) and email(s)

General notes

Client records must be editable and searchable by name, document number, or internal ID.

📂 Client Documents

The system must support uploading and managing documents linked to a registered client.

Requirements:

Upload PDF or image files (JPG, PNG).

Each document must include:

Timestamp when the status was updated

The system must allow filtering documents by status, date, or client.

Each upload must record who uploaded it and when.

📝 Integrated Document Editor

The application must include an integrated text editor to create and edit legal documents (e.g., powers of attorney, declarations, etc.), with the following capabilities:

Automatically insert client data from registered clients (e.g., name, CPF, address).

Basic text formatting (bold, italic, alignment, tables, etc.).

Ability to save the document as PDF or print directly.

Version history (optional).

🗄️ General Features

Global search bar.

Audit logs of actions (logins, edits, document uploads).

Modern, clean, and intuitive interface (preferably built with React, Vue, or Angular).

Secure and well-structured backend (Node.js, Python/Django, or Laravel — as the model suggests).

Relational database (PostgreSQL or MySQL).

📱 Compatibility

Responsive design, optimized for computers, tablets, and smartphones.

Future-ready for mobile deployment (as a PWA, React Native, or Flutter app).

⚙️ Additional Features (Optional but Recommended)

💡 Goal:
